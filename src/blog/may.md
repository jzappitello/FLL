May 2024 FLL Meeting _w/o quorum present_

  

**In attendance:** Frank Ascione, Naomi Timm, Joseph Anderson, Shelley Dodd, Nick Eastmond (who joined our meeting to see if FLL members were interested in helping international people receive libraries/books)

  
We welcomed Nick Eastmond, changes were made to the agenda which we could not approve because of a lack of a quorum. Frank mentioned the disposition of the newspapers, magazines and comics. Logan Herald Journal/Centennial celebration special issues= the recorder at the mayor’s office does not want them per Joseph. The remaining issues of the newspapers and magazines and playbills to a thrift store in town called Victorian Rose. They will donate to FLL if they sell any of the items. The Nerd Shop in SLC is willing to take the comics for $20, Frank was going to check if they would donate $50.

  
Frank is working on fundraising. Terry Tempest William has just released a new book called, “Oracle Bones” and she worked with an illustrator, Gaylord Schanilec, who does woodcut prints. The book is large format it’s $350 all hand-stamped and bound. We’re hoping to Gaylord Schanilec to come in the Fall sometime and talk about the process of his work. He needs $2500 honorarium plus travel expenses from Michigan, we have $250 from USU Wildlife Dept., $250 USU Art Dept., and Nick Morrison has committed $250 from the College of the Arts. Frank has also talked with the HASS dean and he was interested in bringing him here and perhaps do a class on campus while he is here.

  
Steve Saporin is writing a book called “The Befana is Returning” and it’s about (Jan. 6) ephipany week in Italy and he has spent a lot of time in Tuscany researching.

  
Bags price reduced. What should we do? Sell them at the Farmer’s Market for $10? Review next meeting when we have a quorum. Naomi mentioned getting as many bags as possible out there to promote FLL.

  
How are library tours going? Naomi has had a great experience doing tours. “The library sells itself.”

  
JaDene has information on the LGBTQ author.
**Possible Event:** Local author event/self-published authors: League of Utah Writers Facebook page---a month to have some self-published authors and having an event in the Fall so USU students could come. Multiple Authors, similar to a fair: authors sign books, meet the authors.

\- Margaret Pettis

\- Frank Ascione

\-Al Forsythe, “Wonderment”

Limit it to 10-12 authors- Naomi is going to develop this idea with a November date in mind.

  
Cache Valley Library Assoc. & Cache Valley Writer’s Group might have some ideas about possible authors.

  
**Old Business:** We’re looking for someone to donate model Trains for front window of the Library---Polar Express and Harry Potter. We need 1-2 train sets and buildings to decorate for Christmas $2000, a donation (Bluetooth controlled) –Wonderful World of Trains- Ogden, Ut may rent one to us. There’s a possibly of having a drawing to win the train if it was not rented. Everyone gets one free ticket and then they can purchase tickets after that. ( approx. 4’ x 12’ ). Thanksgiving to early January?

Anderson Seed and Feed – donate tree to display during Christmas time to take back after Christmas? – free advertising

  
Nick is going to call Dave Merrill to see if he is willing to donate a train. Announce the winner of the drawing at the Steve Saporin event in January. Epiphany is January 6.
